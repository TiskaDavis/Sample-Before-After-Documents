# Before and After Documents

This repository showcases sample documents demonstrating my process of enhancing technical content through research, collaboration, and editing. Each set of documents includes a **Before** version (the original document) and an **After** version (the enhanced document) that has been researched, verified for accuracy with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), programmers, support techs, and end-users, and then formatted for publication.

## Process Overview

The documents in this repository demonstrate my approach to technical writing and content enhancement:

1. **Before**: The original versions of the documents before any modifications were made. These documents typically required additional research and clarification.
2. **Research & Collaboration**: I worked closely with SMEs, programmers, support technicians, and end-users to gather the necessary information and ensure accuracy. This research process helped uncover essential details that were missing or unclear in the initial documents.
3. **After**: After gathering the relevant information, I edited and formatted the documents to improve clarity, accuracy, and readability. These final versions were reviewed and approved for publication.

## How to Use

1. **View Before and After Documents**:
   - Click on the links above to view and compare the **Before** and **After** versions of each document. This allows you to see how the content was transformed through the enhancement process.

2. **Understanding the Enhancement Process**:
   - Review the **Before** documents to understand the initial content.
   - Compare with the **After** documents to see how I structured the information, improved accuracy, clarified instructions, and applied formatting for readability and consistency.

## Why This Matters

The "Before and After" documents serve as a valuable showcase of my skills in:

- **Research**: Gathering and validating the right information to ensure the content is accurate and reliable.
- **Collaboration**: Working with various stakeholders such as SMEs, programmers, support teams, and end-users to gather insights and feedback.
- **Content Enhancement**: Editing and restructuring documents to make them clearer, more organized, and easier for users to understand.
- **Formatting and Publishing**: Preparing documents for final publication, ensuring they are visually appealing and professionally presented.
